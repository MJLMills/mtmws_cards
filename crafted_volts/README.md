A utility card for the WS Computer to manually set voltages with the input knobs and switch. In the future it will also attenuvert incomming voltages. 

Audio output 1: Main knob position mapped to voltage
Audio output 2: Main knob (inverted) position mapped to voltage
CV output 1   : X knob posision mapped to voltage
CV output 2   : Y knob posision mapped to voltage
Pulse output 1: Z switch off = 0v, momentary or on = ~6v
Pulse output 2: Z switch off = ~6v, momentary or on = 0v

Note: I'm not sure if/how useful this card will be to anyone, I wrote it to learn the Computer hardware and to make sure it's all controllable from Rust before working on something more complex.

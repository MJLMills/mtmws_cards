# Backyard Rain Soundscape

A port of the [Backyard Rain Soundscape](https://briandorsey.itch.io/backyard-rain-soundscape) Playdate app to the Music Thing Modular Workshop System Computer. 

Nature soundscape audio. A cozy rain ambience mix for background listening. You control the intensity. This card plays rain ambience which was recorded in my backyard. 

* Use the main knob to adjust rain intensity. (it cross fades between three recordings)
* Never hear the loops: detailed natural recordings recordings of different lengths and slowly adjusted playback mix. (LFO mixed with main knob.) 

*"It's such a cozy little app."* -- my brother

Recording info:

* LOM UÅ¡i omni microphones, separated by about 1.5m (5ft)
* Cinela Leonard wind protection
* Sony A10 recorder & a small Anker USB power supply
* recorded overnight June 2023, Seattle, WA, USA

Note: a 16MB card is required and will be nearly full of rain audio.

# Backyard Rain Soundscape

A port of the [Backyard Rain Soundscape](https://briandorsey.itch.io/backyard-rain-soundscape) Playdate app to the Music Thing Modular Workshop System Computer. 

Nature soundscape audio. A cozy rain ambience mix for background listening. You control the intensity.  

Audio from Playdate sounds *so* good, we need some natural soundscapes on it. This app plays rain ambience recorded in my backyard. 

* Use the main knob to adjust rain intensity. (it cross fades between three recordings)
* Never hear the loops: detailed natural recordings recordings of different lengths and slowly adjusted playback mix. 

"It's such a cozy little app." -- my brother
